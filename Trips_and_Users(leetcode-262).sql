--TRIPS table

--id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
--The table holds all taxi trips. Each trip has a unique id, while client_id and driver_id are 
--foreign keys to the users_id at the Users table.
--Status is an ENUM (category) type of ('completed', 'cancelled_by_driver', 'cancelled_by_client').

--USERS table

--users_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
--The table holds all users. Each user has a unique users_id, and role is an ENUM type of ('client', 'driver', 'partner').
--banned is an ENUM (category) type of ('Yes', 'No').

--QUESTION ?

--The cancellation rate is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by client or driver) requests with unbanned users 
--by the total number of requests with unbanned users on that day.

--Write a solution to find the cancellation rate of requests with unbanned users 
--(both client and driver must not be banned) each day between "2013-10-01" and "2013-10-03". 
--Round Cancellation Rate to two decimal points.
